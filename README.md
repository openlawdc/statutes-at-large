Figure out a way to free up the new DC Statutes at Large 

See here: http://dccouncil.us/files/user_uploads/event_testimony/20_DCSTAT_Q1.pdf

Created a template for an XML version of a Statutes at Large entry and a really basic stylesheet. Next step is to make the Statutes at Large interact with the Code in a cool way. And then the next next step is writing the Statutes at Large in XML directly. Clever web dev help wanted. -VDZ
